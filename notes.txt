Blockchain is Distributed Ledger Technology.

1.Upcoding of services:

Billing insurers for services that are more costly than the actual procedure that was done.
Clients claiming more money form the insurers than what actually costed for them at the hospital.

2.Upcoding of items:

Similar to upcoding of services but involving the use of medical equipment.
Hosptials providing the insurance company that they have done the treatment worth for more money than what actually costed for the client.

3.Billing for services not rendered:

Billing insurers for fake medical claims.
These can be prevented using blockchain because the insurance company will get both the data from hospital and well as the client and all that data is stored in a blockchain which can be viewed by all of them for authnenticity purposes of making the right claim.
Client can see what is being claimed on his name by the hospital and the hospital can see what is claimed by client at the insurance company.
This ensures that no fake or tampered claims are being made.
If any new change occurs legally a new block will be added with the updated information to the blockchain but no pre-existing data can be modified.

4.Duplicate claims:

In this case a provider does not submit exactly the same bill, but changes some small portion like the date in order to charge Medicare twice for the same service rendered.
This cannot be done because of implementing the blockchain tampering will be made difficult since blockchain is a distributed ledger and hence the entity will have to tamper more than 51% of the P2P distributed ledger system and also we will have the information of the entire history of the entity and all the claims the entity has ever made untampered.
